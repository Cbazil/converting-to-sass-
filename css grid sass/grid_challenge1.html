                        <p> Garth is my Code Coach and he's extremely helpful and a friendly, I enjoy working with him. He's a good coach and can make your day with a fun ice breaker activity or by just telling the class a story or a little Joke. He treats us all as equals and each with respect.
                        </p>
                        <p> When Garth reviews my projects and Challenges he'll always compliment me on areas I did good on and then tells me exactly where I can improve on. His assistance has been real helpful to my growth within the coding course. I have no complaint on his behaviorour or performance as I find it great.
